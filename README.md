This repository is documentation of Apigee 

## Local Setup

For exploring Apigee we are going to create Micro services in local machine and going to expose those services as API's using Apigee X.
For this we need to expose our MS urls to internet which can be done using ngrok.


## ngrok setup
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup

Once ngrok is setup create a sample spring boot app and run it in local and expose it to internet using ngrok.

To run ngrok in local machine with basic auth use following command

ngrok http 8080 --basic-auth 'username:password'

Once its started successfully we can see following log.

Forwarding     https://821b-65-27-244-128.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080

Everytime when we retsrt the ngrok https://<host-name> will change for each restarts.

  It will display following page

  Provide API name and other info. For this example we are not giving any basepath.
  
  TargetURL will be our locally running ngrok endpoint which intern connect to local running mcicroservice.

  Choose Passthrough option to make it simple. This API will passthrough whatever request which is coming.

  If everything is good new proxy will be created.

  We have to deploy newly created proxy. Choose revision and deploy.

  Deployment status will be updated upon successful deployment

  To get Proxy Host to form API URL

## Apigee API concepts
  
  ### Developer
  
  A Developer is a App builder or group of App builders who will consume API's which is exposed via Apigee.
  A developer is an internal or external entity who will consume exposed API's.
  
  Ex. A website/app Developer can use Google Analytics API to collect user interation information on the Website. 
      In this case team or person owning the Website is Developer.
  
  ### Product
  
  A product is bundle of API's and its resources clubbed together and those API's in a product are given access
  to specific Developer teams.
  
  When a company develop different API's and use those API's internally as well as expose to external partners.
  In this case it can create 2 different Product bundling those API's in which internal team product can have
  all the API's whereas external team Product bundle will have only specific API's. 
  
  These Product's then will be assigned with different API keys and shared between two different App development teams.
  
  ### Apps
  
  An App/Apps are API consumers. They will registered with an API providers organization and get API key specific 
  to their API product upon registration.
